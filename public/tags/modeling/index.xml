Timeline 2020-2022
Project Goal There are two main goals of this project. The first goal is to identify stakeholder (i.e., natural resources managers) priorities, knowledge gaps, and barriers to implementing machine learning for natural resources management (e.g., agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, water resources, etc.). The second is to develop educational materials based on the findings of the first goal to empower use of machine learning and other data-driven decision support tools for natural resources management.</description>

Timeline 2019-2020
Project Goal The goal of this project was to use machine learning models for two applications in hydrology. First, we used a hierarchical machine learning ensemble model to predict streamflow. Then, we assessed model sensitivies to learn how changes in the percentage of different types of land cover in specific places in the watershed influenced (i.</description>

Timeline 2017-2019
Project Goal The goal of this project is to combine past and future hydrology model (i.e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)) outputs with demographics data to create maps and prioritize climate change adaptation planning for especially vulnerable communities in western North Carolina&amp;rsquo;s Yadkin-Pee Dee River Watershed.</description>

Timeline 2014-2015
Project Goal The goal of this project was to test (1) the impact of alternating anaerobic/aerobic conditions on phosphorus cycling in stream biofilms and (2) whether observed patterns mimicked those of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in specialized waste-water treatment plants.

Timeline 2012-2015
Project Goal The goal of this project was to test two spatial statistics approaches (i.e., kriging based on Euclidian or stream-wise distances) for predicting in-stream water quality at unsampled locations in the Mianus River near Bedford, NY and Stanford, CT.
