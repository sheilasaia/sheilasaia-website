Timeline 2012-2015
Project Goal The goal of this project was to test two spatial statistics approaches (i.e., kriging based on Euclidian or stream-wise distances) for predicting in-stream waterquality at unsampled locations in the Mianus River near Bedford, NY and Stanford, CT.

Timeline 2014-2015
Project Goal The goal of this project was to test (1) the impact of alternating anaerobic/aerobic conditions on phosphorus cycling in stream biofilms and (2) whether observed patterns mimicked those of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in specialized waste-water treatment plants.

Timeline 2007-2011
Project Goal The goal of this project was to use an exisiting process-based model (i.e., the USDA WEPP model to develop a web-based hydrologic characterization tool (HCT) that could be used by water resources managers to evaluate the impact of agricultural best management practices on water quality (i.</description>
