      <title>R Resources for Water Scientist</title>

      <description>Background In thinking about all the different topics I could possibly write about in th cover in the wateR blog,
 Goals of This Post The main goal of this blog post is to:
 Compile links to R resources including: packages, tutorials, books, etc. that might be of interests to water scientists.  Note to self that someday maybe I can update this post to also include Python resources.</description>

      <title>APIs to the Rescue (&amp; the Census of Agriculture)</title>

      <description>Background Application program interfaces (APIs) help users access (“API request”) and retrieve (“API response”) data from web-based, data servers via programs like R, Python, etc. If you’re interested in more details, several others before me have done a great job writing about API’s and R: this post by C. Waldhauser and this post by T. Clavelle.
I recently learned about a few R packages that help users interface directly with APIs and a few of these are especially interesting for water-minded, data loving people like me.</description>

      <title>Tidy Tuesday Hydrology Version: Tidying Up SWAT Outputs</title>
      <link>/post/2018-10-16-tidy-swat/</link>

      <description>Background I recently participated in Thomas Mock’s Tidy Tuesday R challenge with other members of the NC State University R Learning Group. It was a lot of fun and after participating, I felt motivated to share what I’ve been doing to tidy up my own data sets.
Specifically, I’ve been working with collaborator, Kelly Suttles, to tidy up model outputs from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT is a hydrologic model used to predict daily and monthly streamflow and water quality at the watershed-scale.</description>

      <title>Using tibbletime::rollify with USGS Streamgage Data</title>

      <description>Background While attending rstudio::conf 2018, I heard about the tibbletime package developed by Davis Vaughan and Matt Dancho for analysis of time series data. In his conference talk, Davis Vaughan presented several business/finance examples to showcase tibbletime’s functionality and mentioned a few, general non-business applications at the end of his talk. I couldn’t help but think about how this package might be especially helpful for environmental scientists working with time series data.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the wateR blog! I’ve been considering starting a water-centric data science blog for a while now. Getting this blogdown website up and running has helped solidify my motivation to write regularly about water-related data science advances that are available to R users…and maybe Python users too (both languages are so useful!).
Some of the specific goals of this blog are to (in no special order):
 Practice developing my science communication and R skills.</description>
