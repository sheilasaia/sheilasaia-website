# Timeline
2017-2019

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to combine past and future hydrology model (i.e., [Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)](https://swat.tamu.edu/)) outputs with demographics data to create maps and prioritize climate change adaptation planning for especially vulnerable communities in western North Carolina's Yadkin-Pee Dee River Watershed.
