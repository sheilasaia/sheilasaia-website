# Timeline
2020-2022

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a web application (web app) forecast tool, called ShellCast. ShellCast helps North Carolina shellfish growers anticipate temporary harvest area closures due to excess rainfall and make data-driven decisions about their aquaculture operations. Forecast information on temporary closures is helpful because closures impact business: shellfish growers cannot harvest shellfish when a temporary closure is in effect.
