# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to collaborate with a law student (M Bowes) and a natural resources student (M Kurth) at Cornell University to synthesize a report on local water resources for the Municipality of Neapolis in Crete, Greece. This report also included a series of recommendations for the Municipality to consider as they adapt to increasing water scarcity in the region.
