# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to test two spatial statistics approaches (i.e., kriging based on Euclidian or stream-wise distances) for predicting in-stream waterquality at unsampled locations in the Mianus River near Bedford, NY and Stanford, CT.

# Project Links
Results of this project are currently unpublished.
