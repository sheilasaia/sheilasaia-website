# past teaching:

As a [Cornell University Center for Teaching Excellence](https://www.cte.cornell.edu/) fellow, I taught 2, 2-hour workshops each semester from September 2014 to May 2016 on topics including:

- Developing Effective Rubrics
- Using Active Learning Strategies
- Assessing Student Learning
- Service Learning
- Facilitating Classroom Discussions
- Developing and Maintaining Inclusive Classrooms
- Future Faculty Preparation
- Developing Learning Outcomes

I was a teaching assistant (TA) for two courses at Cornell University:

- *[Watershed Engineering (BEE 4730)](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=404220)* - An senior level capstone engineering course taught by [Dr. M. Todd Walter](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/m-todd-walter). I organized hands-on laboratory and field activities, graded homework (engineering write-ups and reports) and held office hours. I served as a TA for the Fall 2011 and Fall 2012 semesters.

- *[Physical Hydrology for Ecosystems (BEE 3710)](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=404209)* - A junior to senior level course covering concepts related to hydrology and the water cycle taught by [Dr. M. Todd Walter](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/m-todd-walter). I organized hands-on laboratory and field activities, graded homeworks (engineering write-ups and reports), and held office hours. I served as a TA for the Spring 2013 semester.

From August 2007 to August 2008, I taught English as a Second Language to students ages 1 to 60 (private, semi-private, and small class lessons) at Hands-on English in Tokyo, Japan.
