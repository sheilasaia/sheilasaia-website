# upcoming workshops:

- *[Building Better Graphs with R: ggplot and Base](https://www.transmittingscience.org/courses/building-better-graphs-with-r-ggplot2-and-base/)* - I'm co-organizing and co-leading this 5-day course with Dr. Ashton Drew at [Transmitting Science](https://www.transmittingscience.org/) in Barcelona, Spain on November 5-9, 2018. The goal of this course is to train attendees to create publication-quality graphics in R.

- *R for Data Science Book Club* - I'm currently leading a bi-monthly bookclub to work through [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/).

# past workshops: 

- *Exploring Spatial Data with `sf`* - I organized and led a 2-hour workshop for R-Ladies RTP introducing members to the `sf` package in R on July 19, 2018. The repository for this workshop is available [here](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_rtp/tree/master/2018-07-19-sf) and you can read more about the USGS GAGES-II dataset that we used in the tutorial [here](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml).

- *Ecohydrological Modeling for Land and Climate* - I co-organized and co-led this 4-hour workshop with Dr. Kunwar Singh at the [North American International Association for Landscape Ecology (NA-IALE)](http://www.usiale.org/) annual conference in Chicago, IL on April 10, 2017. The goal of this workshop was to train US-IALE members how to calibrate, validate, and visualize SWAT outputs.

- *Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for Ecohydrological Modeling* - I co-organized and co-led this 2-day workshop sponsored by the [NC State University Center for Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) with Dr. Kunwar Singh at NC State University on March 1-2, 2017. The goal of this workshop was to (1) train attendees how to calibrate, validate, and visualize SWAT outputs and (2) encourage a collaborative SWAT-user community at NC State University.

- I lead a [a workshop on tibbles](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/events/243077630/) for [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/).

# past teaching:

As a [Cornell University Center for Teaching Excellence](https://www.cte.cornell.edu/) fellow, I taught 2, 2-hour workshops each semester from September 2014 to May 2016 on topics including:

- Developing Effective Rubrics
- Using Active Learning Strategies
- Assessing Student Learning
- Service Learning
- Facilitating Classroom Discussions
- Developing and Maintaining Inclusive Classrooms
- Future Faculty Preparation
- Developing Learning Outcomes

I was a teaching assistant (TA) for two courses at Cornell University:

- *[Watershed Engineering (BEE 4730)](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=404220)* - An senior level capstone engineering course taught by [Dr. M. Todd Walter](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/m-todd-walter). I organized hands-on laboratory and field activities, graded homework (engineering write-ups and reports) and held office hours. I served as a TA for the Fall 2011 and Fall 2012 semesters.

- *[Physical Hydrology for Ecosystems (BEE 3710)](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=404209)* - A junior to senior level course covering concepts related ot hydrology and the water cycle taught by [Dr. M. Todd Walter](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/m-todd-walter). I organized hands-on laboratory and field activities, graded homeworks (engineering write-ups and reports) and held office hours. I served as a TA for the Spring 2013 semester.

From August 2007 to August 2008, I taught English as a Second Language to students ages 1 to 60 (private, semi-private, and class lessons) at Hands-on English in Tokyo, Japan.
