# upcoming workshops:

- *American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2019 Coding Help Desk* - If you write code for your research and will be attending the AGU 2019 Fall Meeting, consider volunteering at the AGU Coding Help Desk. Find out more about the event and sign-up to volunteer [here](https://github.com/sheilasaia/agu-2019-coding-help-desk).

# past workshops:

- *Data Manipulation, Analysis, and Visualization in R using the Tidyverse* - I'm co-organizing a workshop with Dr. Ashton Drew for [Transmitting Science](https://www.transmittingscience.org/) in Barcelona, Spain from November 4-8, 2019. You can read more about the workshop and sign up [here](https://www.transmittingscience.org/courses/statistics-and-bioinformatics/data-manipulation-analysis-visualization-in-r-using-tidyverse/).

- *Exploring Spatial Data with `sf`* - I organized and lead an workshop introducing to the sf package to NC State BAE 590 students. Code and slides from this class can be found [here](https://github.com/sheilasaia/sf-workshop-bae590).

- *Coding Help Desk* - I co-organized the Coding Help Desk with [Dr. Sam Zipper](https://samzipper.weebly.com/) at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting 2018 in Washington, DC. AGU attendees were welcome to stop by and ask coding related questions to volunteers well-versed in R, Python, MatLab, etc. programming.

- *R for Data Science Book Club* - I lead a bi-monthly bookclub to work through [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/).

- *Exploring Spatial Data with `sf`* - I organized and led a 2-hour workshop for [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) introducing members to the `sf` package in R on July 19, 2018. The repository for this workshop is available [here](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_rtp/tree/master/2018-07-19-sf) and you can read more about the USGS GAGES-II dataset that we used in the tutorial [here](https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/gagesII_Sept2011.xml).

- *Ecohydrological Modeling for Land and Climate Change* - I co-organized and co-led this 4-hour workshop with Dr. Kunwar Singh at the [North American International Association for Landscape Ecology (NA-IALE)](http://www.usiale.org/) annual conference in Chicago, IL on April 10, 2018. The goal of this workshop was to train US-IALE members how to calibrate, validate, and visualize SWAT outputs.

- *Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for Ecohydrological Modeling* - I co-organized and co-led this 2-day workshop sponsored by the [NC State University Center for Geospatial Analytics](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/geospatial/) with Dr. Kunwar Singh at NC State University from March 1-2, 2018. The goal of this workshop was to (1) train attendees how to calibrate, validate, and visualize SWAT outputs and (2) encourage a collaborative SWAT-user community at NC State University.

- I lead a [a workshop on tibbles](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/events/243077630/) for [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/).

# past teaching:

As a [Cornell University Center for Teaching Excellence](https://www.cte.cornell.edu/) fellow, I taught 2, 2-hour workshops each semester from September 2014 to May 2016 on topics including:

- Developing Effective Rubrics
- Using Active Learning Strategies
- Assessing Student Learning
- Service Learning
- Facilitating Classroom Discussions
- Developing and Maintaining Inclusive Classrooms
- Future Faculty Preparation
- Developing Learning Outcomes

I was a teaching assistant (TA) for two courses at Cornell University:

- *[Watershed Engineering (BEE 4730)](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=404220)* - An senior level capstone engineering course taught by [Dr. M. Todd Walter](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/m-todd-walter). I organized hands-on laboratory and field activities, graded homework (engineering write-ups and reports) and held office hours. I served as a TA for the Fall 2011 and Fall 2012 semesters.

- *[Physical Hydrology for Ecosystems (BEE 3710)](http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=26&coid=404209)* - A junior to senior level course covering concepts related to hydrology and the water cycle taught by [Dr. M. Todd Walter](https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/m-todd-walter). I organized hands-on laboratory and field activities, graded homeworks (engineering write-ups and reports), and held office hours. I served as a TA for the Spring 2013 semester.

From August 2007 to August 2008, I taught English as a Second Language to students ages 1 to 60 (private, semi-private, and small class lessons) at Hands-on English in Tokyo, Japan.
