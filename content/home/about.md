# about me

I'm an postdoctoral researcher at NC State University and a member of the [Ecohydrology & Watershed Science Lab](http://ecohydrology.wordpress.ncsu.edu/). My current research focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict and explore how land cover impacts streamflow at national (USA), regional (NC), and local (NC hillslope) scales. I'm broadly interested in research questions exploring the relationships between to humans and water resources (water quantity and water quality).

I also like to help organize [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) events, help update the [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/) directory, contribute to the [FeminaSci Blog](https://www.feminasci.com/discussions-1), volunteer at the [Durham Farmer's Market](http://www.durhamfarmersmarket.com/), explore the outdoors (hiking, biking, climbing, swimming), maintain my cultures ([kombucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) and [sourdough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough#Starter)), and cook/bake for friends.
