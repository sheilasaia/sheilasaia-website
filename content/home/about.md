# about me

I work alongside a team of scientists at the [State Climate Office of North Carolina](https://climate.ncsu.edu/) and am an affiliate of [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). My current research uses data analytics (i.e., data wrangling, statistical and physically-based modeling, and data visualizing) to predict and minimize human impacts on water resources at regional and national scales. I'm passionate about open science and broadly interested in research questions exploring the relationships between humans, climate, and water resources (water quantity and water quality).

I also like to help organize [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) events, help update the [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/) directory, contribute to the [FeminaSci Blog](https://www.feminasci.com/discussions-1), volunteer at the [Durham Farmer's Market](http://www.durhamfarmersmarket.com/), explore the outdoors (hiking, biking, climbing, swimming), maintain my cultures ([kombucha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) and [sourdough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough#Starter)), and cook/bake for friends.
