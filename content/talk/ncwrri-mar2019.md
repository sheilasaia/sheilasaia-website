## Abstract:</br>
When combined, future regional increases in precipitation and impervious surfaces due to urban development will likely increase streamflow. Nearby communities that are unable to prepare, respond, recover, and adapt to these increases in streamflow are at risk of facing negative socioeconomic impacts. Tools are needed to ensure climate change adaption planning efforts identify areas where expected increases in streamflow overlap with vulnerable communities. To address this need, we apply a risk management tool—called a risk matrix—to combine hydrologic model results (i.e., high streamflow projections) and socioeconomic metrics (i.e., social vulnerability index) for the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Watershed in North Carolina. We compare the location of high risk regions in a watershed based on (1) hydrologic model results only, (2) socioeconomic metrics only, and (3) the spatial intersection of both results using the risk matrix. Middle and lower sections of the watershed are at high risk of future increases in streamflow and vulnerable communities are distributed throughout the watershed. Using the risk matrix, we combine these results to identify regions of the watershed where increases in streamflow are largest and may overlap with especially vulnerable communities. This approach may inform first steps in climate change adaptation planning.
