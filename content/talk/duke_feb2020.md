## Abstract:</br>
In this guest lecture for Geospatial Analysis for Conservation Management (ENV 761) at Duke University, I gave an overview of how and why I use R and Python for geospatial analysis. I highlighted my how I've used R and Python in some [recent work](https://sheilasaia.rbind.io/project/nc-sociohydro-project/) in western North Carolina. Last, I led a discussion of a [recenlty published paper](https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/58292) associated with this work.
