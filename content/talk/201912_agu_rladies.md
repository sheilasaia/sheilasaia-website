## Abstract:</br>
R-Ladies Global is a worldwide organization focused on achieving proportionate representation of genders currently underrepresented in the R programming community. To meet this goal, we support a network of local chapters who organize events that encourage, inspire, and empower individuals to meet their programming potential. Since R-Ladies Global was founded in 2016, it has grown to provide training and mentoring to in over 47,000 members, in 159 cities, and 47 countries. Local chapters have held over 1,500 events focused on a wide range of topics from workshops on popular R programming libraries (e.g., ggplot, Shiny) to data science panels on various topics (e.g., Ethics in Data Science, Women in Tech) to hackathons (e.g., #TidyTuesday) to speaking opportunities (e.g., Lightning Talks) to networking events (e.g., dinner meet-ups, book clubs). There are many leadership, training, career development, and mentoring opportunities for early career scientists who join R-Ladies Global. Please stop by our poster or visit our website (https://rladies.org/about-us) to learn more about how you can get involved and/or support our mission.
