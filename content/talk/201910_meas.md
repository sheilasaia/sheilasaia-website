## Bio:</br>
Sheila Saia received her BS in Bioengineering from Binghamton University and her MS and PhD degrees in Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University. She is a postdoctoral researcher in NC State Universityâ€™s Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources and an affiliate of the USDA Forest Service Southern Research Station in RTP. Her current postdoctoral research links hydrologic model (i.e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool; SWAT) results and United States Census data to aid climate change adaptation planning in North Carolina. Sheila has experience using model-, laboratory-, and field-based research to improve water quantity and water quality.
