## Abstract:</br>
The Lost Waterways of Winston-Salem is a free film screening and panel discussion at [a/perture cinema](https://www.aperturecinema.com/f-aq/). Drawing on the Winston-Salem motto of the "City of Arts and Innovation," this event seeks to engage students and community members in a conversation about local water issues by highlighting the connection between STEM and the arts. Beginning at 5:00 PM, all are invited to the Chatham Building Atrium (305 W. 4th St.) to enjoy refreshments, engage with community partners, and explore environmentally-themed artwork by local artists. The screening of [Lost Rivers (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2421498/) will begin at 6pm in a/perture studios 1 & 2. Immediately following the screening, expert panelists will engage in a discussion moderated by Linda Lilienfeld, the ["Let's Talk about Water"](http://letstalkaboutwater.com/) Founder and Project Coordinator. Panelists include: Dr. Lauren Lowman, Dr. Sheila Saia, Kristen Ford Haaf, and Christine Rucker.
