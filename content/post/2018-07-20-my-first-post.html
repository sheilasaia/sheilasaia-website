<p>Welcome to the wateR blog! I’ve been considering starting a water-centric data science blog for a while now. Getting this blogdown website up and running has helped solidify my motivation to write regularly about water-related data science advances that are available to R users…and maybe Python users too (both languages are so useful!).</p>
<p>Some of the specific goals of this blog are to (in no special order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice developing my science communication and R skills.<br></li>
<li>Review and demo new packages, data sets, and methods that might be useful to water resources research.<br></li>
<li>Highlight newly published studies that use data science to advance or could be applied to water resources research.<br></li>
<li>Discuss the present and future of water data science.<br></li>
<li>Interview experts about water-related topics.<br></li>
</ul>
