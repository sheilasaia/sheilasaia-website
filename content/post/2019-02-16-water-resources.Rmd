# Background

In thinking about all the different topics I could possibly write about in th cover in the wate`R` blog, 

# Goals of This Post

The main goal of this blog post is to:

- Compile links to `R` resources including: packages, tutorials, books, etc. that might be of interests to water scientists.

Note to self that someday maybe I can update this post to also include `Python` resources. For now, I'm sticking to basicsssss.

Special thanks to all of the people who've worked hard to share their code and insights together to benefit us all. I love the open source programming community!
